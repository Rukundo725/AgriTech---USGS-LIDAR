# INTRODUCTION

Water is very important for crop growth and health.  We can better predict maize harvest if we better understand how water flows through a field, and which parts are likely to be flooded or too dry. One important ingredient to understanding water flow in a field is by measuring the elevation of the field at many points. The USGS recently released high resolution elevation data as a lidar point cloud called USGS 3DEP in a public dataset on Amazon. This dataset is essential to build models of water flow and predict plant health and maize harvest.
